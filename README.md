# Matplotlib Challenge

Matplotlib Visualizations

For this assignment, I was tasked with analyzing the data collected on various drug treatments for skin cancer on mice. 

Pymaceuticals Inc. is a burgeoning pharmaceutical company based out of San Diego, CA. Pymaceuticals specializes in drug-based, anti-cancer pharmaceuticals. In their most recent efforts, they've since begun screening for potential treatments to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

I’ve been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 250 mice were treated through a variety of drug regimens over the course of 45 days. Their physiological responses were then monitored over the course of that time. My objective is to analyze the data to show how four treatments (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo) compare.

I am tasked with:

-	Creating a scatter plot that shows how the tumor volume changes over time for each treatment.
-	Creating a scatter plot that shows how the number of metastatic (cancer spreading) sites changes over time for each treatment.
-	Creating a scatter plot that shows the number of mice still alive through the course of treatment (Survival Rate).
-	Creating a bar graph that compares the total % tumor volume change for each drug across the full 45 days.
-	Documenting 3 observations about the results of the study based on the visualizations generated from the study data.

To analyze the data, I am required to use the Pandas Library, Jupyter Notebook, and the Matplotlib Library. Error bars must also be included in the scatter plots. The scatter plots will allow the company to account for variability between mice.

In this repository, there is a Jupyter Notebook named “Matplotlib_Homework_V1” which holds all the code used to analyze the data. Observations of the data are also included in the notebook.

The following graphs are included as separate images:

1.	"Tumor Volume Response to Treatment”
2.	“Metastatic Spread During Treatment”
3.	“Survival Rate During Treatment"
4.	"Percent Change of Tumor Volume Over 45 Day Treatment” 

There is also a PDF file named “Analysis of Pymaceuticals SCC Drug Treatments.” It is a report of the observations made based on the data from the graphs created.

Along with what we learned in class, I also used the following resources to complete this assignment:
